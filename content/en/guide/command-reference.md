title: "Command reference"
weight: 3
summary: "A categorized quick reference for the Celebi shell, one-shot CLI, and Git commands."
---

Celebi has three entry points: `celebi` enters the persistent interactive shell,
`celebi-cli COMMAND` runs one operation for scripts, and `celebi-git COMMAND`
contains Git integration. The tables use the canonical command names shared by
the shell and `celebi-cli` unless marked shell-only. Square brackets `[ ]` mark
optional arguments.

Inside `celebi`, bare `helpme` gives object-aware guidance. These three forms show
the same detailed command documentation:

```text
help status
helpme status
status --help
```

Use `celebi-cli COMMAND --help` outside the shell. Compatibility spellings remain
callable and are listed separately by `celebi-cli --help`.
